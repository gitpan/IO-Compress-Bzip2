  2.000_11 22 March 2006

      * Beefed up 050interop-bzip2.t to check that the external bzip2 command
        works as expected before starting the tests. This means that
        this test harness will just be skipped on problematic systems.

      * Split IO::Compress::Bzip2 into its own distribution.
