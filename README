DESCRIPTION
-----------


This module provides a Perl interface to allow reading and writing of 
bzip2 files/buffers.





PREREQUISITES
-------------

Before you can build IO::Compress::Bzip2 you need to have the following
installed on your system:


    * Perl 5.004 or better. 
    * Compress::Raw::Bzip2
    * IO::Compress::Base





BUILDING THE MODULE
-------------------

Assuming you have met all the prerequisites, the module can now be built
using this sequence of commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test



INSTALLATION
------------

To install IO::Compress::Bzip2, run the command below:

    make install

FEEDBACK
--------

How to report a problem with IO::Compress::Bzip2.

To help me help you, I need all of the following information:

 1. The Versions of everything relevant.
    This includes:

     a. The *complete* output from running this
     
            perl -V
     
        Do not edit the output in any way.
        Note, I want you to run "perl -V" and NOT "perl -v".
     
        If your perl does not understand the "-V" option it is too
        old. This module needs Perl version 5.004 or better.     

     b. The version of IO::Compress::Bzip2 you have. 
        If you have successfully installed IO::Compress::Bzip2, this one-liner
        will tell you:

           perl -MIO::Compress::Bzip2 -e 'print qq[ver $IO::Compress::Bzip2::VERSION\n]'

        If you areplete* output from running this
     
            perl -V
     
        Do not edit the output in any way.
        Note, I want you to run "perl -V" and NOT "perl -v".
     
        If your perl does not understand the "-V" option it is too
        old. This module needs Perl version 5.004 or better.     

     b. The version of IO::Compress::Bzip2 you have. 
        If you have successfully installed IO::Compress::Bzip2, this one-liner
        will tell you:

           perl -MIO::Compress::Bzip2 -e 'print qq[ver $IO::Compress::Bzip2::VERSION\n]'

        If you are  running windows use this

           perl -MIO::Compress::Bzip2 -e "print qq[ver $IO::Compress::Bzip2::VERSION\n]"

        If you haven't installed IO::Compress::Bzip2 then search IO::Compress::Bzip2.pm
        for a line like this:

          $VERSION = "1.05" ;



 2. If you are having problems building IO::Compress::Bzip2, send me a
    complete log of what happened. Start by unpacking the IO::Compress::Bzip2
    module into a fresh directory and keep a log of all the steps

        [edit config.in, if necessary]
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test TEST_VERBOSE=1
